# SharePoint Definition Files
This library generates the TypeScript definition files from the $metadata REST endpoint in SharePoint. This will allow anyone to import the definition files to be used in any project, which isn't linked to a framework.

## Example
```
import { 
    MS,
    Microsoft,
    OBA,
    PS,
    SP,
    SPO
 } from "gd-sprest-def";
```
